Created this Black Jack game as a part of my journey to learn and understand JavaScript in scrimba.
This game is a simple implementation of the classic card game Black Jack. The game requires the players to pick two cards initially from the deck and the sum is observed if it is 21 you win or if the sum is more than 21 then you lose or if the sum is less than 21 you get to pick another card.
